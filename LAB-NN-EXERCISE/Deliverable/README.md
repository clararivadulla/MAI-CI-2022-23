There are three files in this directory:
    - `main.m`: which contains the grid search for the different parameters found in the report
    - `trainer.m`: which contains a wrapper function that sets the parameters for a feedforward network in Matlab and trains it.
    - `Report.pdf`: report with our conclusions.
