## Abstract

The applications of artificial neural networks in the cosmological field have shone successfully during the past decade, this is due to their great ability of modeling large amounts of datasets and complex nonlinear functions. However, in some cases, their use still remains controversial becasue their ease of producing inaccurate results when the hyperparameters are not carefully selected. In this paper, to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters that describe the artificial neural networks, we propose to take advantage of the genetic algorithms. As a proof of the concept, we analyze three different cosmological cases to test the performance of the new architecture achieved with the genetic algorithms and compare the output with the standard process, consisting of a grid with all possible configurations. First, we carry out a model-independent reconstruction of the distance modulus using a Type Ia Supernovae compilation. Second, the neural networks learn to solve dynamical system of the Universe's content, and finally with the latest Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release we train the networks for the classification of astronomical objects. We found that the genetic algorithms improve considerably the generation of the architecture, which can ensure more confidence in their physical results because of the better performance in the metrics with respect to the grid method.
